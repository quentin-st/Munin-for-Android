<h1>NAME</h1> 
<p>snmp__netapp_inodeusage_ - Munin plugin to retrieve inodes usage on NetApp storage appliances.</p> 
<h1>APPLICABLE SYSTEMS</h1> 
<p>Inodes usage stats should be reported by any NetApp storage appliance with SNMP agent daemon activated. See na_snmp(8) for details.</p> 
<h1>CONFIGURATION</h1> 
<p>Unfortunately, SNMPv3 is not fully supported on all NetApp equipments. For this reason, this plugin will use SNMPv2 by default, which is insecure because it doesn't encrypt the community string.</p> 
<p>The following parameters will help you get this plugin working :</p> 
<pre>  [snmp_*]
     env.community MyCommunity</pre> 
<p>If your community name is 'public', you should really worry about security and immediately reconfigure your appliance.</p> 
<p>Please see 'perldoc Munin::Plugin::SNMP' for further configuration.</p> 
<h1>MIB INFORMATION</h1> 
<p>This plugin requires support for the NETWORK-APPLIANCE-MIB issued by Network Appliance. It reports the content of the DfEntry OID.</p>
