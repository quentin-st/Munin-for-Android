<h1>NAME</h1> 
<p>snmp__uptime - Munin plugin to retrieve uptime information from a SNMP device.</p> 
<h1>APPLICABLE SYSTEMS</h1> 
<p>Uptime should be supported by all SNMP devices that support SNMPv2 and up (If I have understood the MIBs rightly :-)</p> 
<h1>CONFIGURATION</h1> 
<p>As a rule SNMP plugins need site specific configuration. The default configuration (shown here) will only work on insecure sites/devices.</p> 
<pre>   [snmp_*]
        env.version 2
        env.community public</pre> 
<p>In general SNMP is not very secure at all unless you use SNMP version 3 which supports authentication and privacy (encryption). But in any case the community string for your devices should not be &quot;public&quot;.</p> 
<p>Please see 'perldoc Munin::Plugin::SNMP' for further configuration information.</p> 
<h1>INTERPRETATION</h1> 
<p>The plugin reports how long the device has been up. This is not the same as uptime in percent as used in SLAs.</p> 
<p>Actually, this isn't entirely true. It reports the uptime of the SNMP agent. For &quot;embedded&quot; devices such as switches or printers, this will be the same as uptime, but this may not always be the case for servers. (For instance, it would be less if an administrator had manually restarted the SNMP daemon/service.)</p> 
<p>The day and week graphs for uptime are not very interesting - the year, and perhaps the month graphs are more interesting. The year graphs average number will show your devices average uptime the last year (actually 400 days).</p> 
<h1>MIB INFORMATION</h1> 
<p>This plugin requires support for the DISMAN-EVENT-MIB authored by the IETF Distributed Management Working Group. It reports the contents of the sysUpTimeInstance OID.</p>
